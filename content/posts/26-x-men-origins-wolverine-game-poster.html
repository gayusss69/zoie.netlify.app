    <p>I won’t be hanging this on my wall, but it’s good enough. 30/01/2009 · finally, we have an official wolverine poster for you. The last time that a poster popped up was almost a year ago, but that turned out to be a fan made fake (albeit a pretty nice one). Wolverine, although they&#039;re counting on hugh jackman with mutton chops and his trademark claws to tell you which movie it&#039;s for. I can’t wait to see this.</p>
